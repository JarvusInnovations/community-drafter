# Lean home vs live dashboard

The upstream `axi` skill says the no-args home view should show **content, not a usage manual**
(§8). When your CLI ships as a skill with a SessionStart hook, that principle splits into two
distinct surfaces, because the hook loads on *every* session and must stay cheap. Getting this
split right is item #6 in [kunchenguid/axi#46](https://github.com/kunchenguid/axi/issues/46).

## The two surfaces

| | **home** (no-args) | **dashboard** |
|---|---|---|
| Contains | identity / auth status + command reference | live situational state |
| Cost | cheap — local reads or a single never-error identity call | real data fetch, possibly several sections |
| Live data? | **no** | **yes** |
| Default hook | global, every session | on-demand, or **project-scoped** hook |
| Resilience | must never error (exit 0 even offline) | may error normally |

The split resolves the tension in `axi` §7 (session-start context must be ruthlessly minimal): the
*minimal* thing (home) is the always-on global default; the *comprehensive* thing (dashboard) is a
deliberate, on-demand or project-pinned opt-in. You don't need a `--compact` middle ground.

Note the nuance: for some tools the home view **is** live content and is cheap (specops' home is
the plans dashboard — pure local file reads). In that case home and dashboard can be the same
thing. The split matters most when "live state" means a network call or expensive computation.

## home: identity + reference, offline-safe

The home view is the global every-session payload, so:

- Lead with the identity header the `axi` SDK prepends (`bin:` / `description:`).
- Show **auth/config status**, resolved from a single never-error call (or local config). If the
  server is unreachable or unconfigured, render a status line + a "run `mytool config set …`"
  hint and **exit 0** — an erroring SessionStart hook is worse than a degraded one.
- Carry the command reference (from `COMMAND_GROUPS`) so the agent learns the surface once per
  session. (If you decide the reference belongs only in `--help`, then home carries just identity +
  a couple of next-step hints — that's a fine choice too, and lighter.)
- **No live data.** Open sessions, current items, counts — those are dashboard territory.

## dashboard: comprehensive coverage, bounded depth

The dashboard is the rich view. Whether personal or entity-focused, the same discipline applies:

- **Comprehensive in coverage, bounded in depth.** Show every relevant section, but cap each one
  (top-N + truncation + a drill-down pointer). A session-start payload that dumps everything blows
  the token budget every session; one that's too thin makes the agent issue follow-up calls.
- **Order sections by ambient value.** Put the most orienting information first — identity, then
  the identifiers the agent will need before it asks (recently-touched entities, slugs), then
  open/overdue items, then activity, then broader context. The tail is what gets cut when context
  is trimmed, so the head must carry the orientation.
- **Hand the agent identifiers up front.** A short list of `type·name·slug` for things the user
  recently touched is a huge head-start — the agent can act without a discovery round trip.
- **Drop redundant columns per surface.** A personal dashboard omits `assignee` (all yours); an
  entity dashboard keeps it. Don't reuse one schema across surfaces where a column is constant.
- **One call, server-side personalization.** Fold "where you left off" into the data endpoint
  (it already knows the user); don't reconstruct it with extra CLI round trips. Thin client,
  server authoritative — the web UI then gets the same view for free.

## Personal vs entity (extended) dashboards

Two dashboard flavors, both useful as project-level hooks:

- **Personal dashboard** (`dashboard`, no args): the team-member's situational awareness — *your*
  overdue/upcoming commitments, *your* recent activity, active projects, pipeline. Scope items to
  the current user.
- **Entity / extended dashboard** (`dashboard <type:slug>… [--related]`): blends specific
  entities into a focused view for a repo whose work is *about* those entities. Merged open items
  across the focal set, a merged chronological feed, and the related-entity neighborhood
  (`--related` = one-hop FK expansion). This is what you pin as a **project hook** so a repo opens
  oriented to its engagement — see `references/session-hooks.md` for the install command.

## How the two stack at the project level

Because Claude Code runs SessionStart hooks from both user and project settings additively, a
session in a project-hooked repo receives **home (global) + dashboard (project)** together. Design
the dashboard payload to *omit* the command reference, since the global home already injected it
that session. The two are complementary by construction, not duplicative.
